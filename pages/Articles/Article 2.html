        <p>Shrubs are any sort of woody, perpetual, thick plants that branch into a few stems or trunks at the base and is littler than a tree. Shrubs are easy to spot, they are generally short and bushy and one does not see a significant part of the stem. Shrubs are otherwise called bushes</p>

    <p>rees reduce the 'Greenhouse' effect by removing carbon dioxide from the air and releasing oxygen. Each year a mature tree produces enough oxygen for 10 people. Trees are also an effective sound barrier and can limit noise pollution. Recent research shows that trees also help reduce the stress of modern life.</p>

<p>Creepers, as the name suggests, are plants that creep on the ground. They have very fragile, long, thin stems that can neither stand erect nor support all their weight. Examples include watermelon, strawberry, pumpkin and sweet potatoes.</p>
